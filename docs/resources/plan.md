# backupdr_plan (Resource)

Backup plans are the binding of templates ids, profiles ids to application ids management console shows when an application (VM, Filesystem or Database) is protected. Templates define how often to back up application data, how long to retain the application data backups, and where and how to replicate the application's data backups. Use the backup templates  to create policies and resource profiles to specify which backup/recovery appliance is used to manage the backup plan. A backup plans violation occurs when data is not being backed up according to the boundaries you have set in a templates policy. For more information, see [Backup plan](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs/concepts/backup-plan).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "backupdr_plan" "example" {
  description = "<SLA description>"
  scheduleoff = "true"
  application = {
    id = 1234 ## <application-id>
  }
  slt = {
    id = 18123 ## <sla-template-id>
  }
  slp = {
    id = 4208 ## <sla-profile-id>
  }
}
```
